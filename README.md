# Simple Neural Network
My first neural network made by following the book "Make Your Own Neural Network: A Gentle Journey Through the Mathematics of Neural Networks, and Making Your Own Using the Python Computer Language" by Tariq Rashid.

### Examples
There are two examples:  
One is simple XOR problem which is inspired by Daniel Shiffman from "The Coding Train" YouTube channel.

Second example is recognizing handwritten number using MNIST handwritten digit database.  
Existing datasets are smaller due to size limits. Full version .csv files: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
